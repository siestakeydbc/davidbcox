# 🔐 David B. Cox – Cloud Security & Offensive Security Trainee

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a cybersecurity professional passionate about **penetration testing**, **cloud security**, and **Active Directory exploitation**, combining hands-on lab experience with a strategic academic background.

🎓 I hold a **Master of Professional Studies in Cybersecurity Strategy and Information Management** from **The George Washington University**, and bring years of experience securing clinical systems in the healthcare industry.

Currently, I’m pursuing:
- 🧠 **eJPT** and **AWS Cloud Practitioner** – May 2025
- 🎯 Long-term: **OSCP** and **AWS Security Specialty**

---

## 🧪 Technical Focus

My work centers on simulating real-world attacks across identity and cloud environments, including:

- 🔐 **Active Directory Attacks** – BloodHound, SharpHound, Rubeus  
- ☁️ **AWS IAM Misconfiguration Testing** – CloudGoat, ScoutSuite, Pacu  
- 🧱 **Red Team Labs** – TryHackMe Red Team Path, Privilege Escalation, AD Enumeration  
- 💬 Documenting all labs with detailed walkthroughs, tooling insights, and remediation logic

## 🔄 What Drives Me

I thrive in hands-on environments where I can **think like an attacker to strengthen defenses**. Coming from a healthcare IT background, I’ve seen how security failures affect people — not just systems.

I believe offensive skills should support resilient architecture, and every finding should tell a story that helps blue teams build smarter.

## 🔍 What’s Next

- ✅ Complete eJPT + AWS CP in May 2025  
- 🚧 Build a GitHub portfolio with lab walkthroughs, tool demos, and cloud exploitation paths  
- 🧠 Dive deeper into cloud-native red teaming and AD escalation simulation
